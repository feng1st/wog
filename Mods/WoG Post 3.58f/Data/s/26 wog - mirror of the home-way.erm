**  Mirror of the Home-Way Script Version 1.1 created by Sir Four
**  Requires WoG version 3.57 or later using ERM version 2.6 or later. 
**  WoGify Name: script52.erm 

** Updated September 15, 2004 by Timothy to change y variables in local
** trigger sections to y- variables, October 16, 2004 by Timothy to correct a
** minor bug.

** Special thanks to Timothy E. Pulver for the Summoning Stones Script
** which the Mirror of the Home-Way Script was based on

** Mirror of the Home-Way building works as 'Town Portal' spell for 1000 coins. 
** i.e. this script lets a hero travel to any town the player owns
** by visiting the Mirror of the Home-Way and spending 1000 coins. 
 
** To install this script in a map, simply copy & paste the code into a global 
** (timed) event. Copy the entire code, from ZVSE to the end. Make sure 
** that you disable ALL colours from receiving the event and/or change 
** the event day to something like 500 or later to avoid the ERM script 
** popping up as if it were a regular event message. The title of the event 
** is unimportant, but I would suggest something like "Mirror of the Home-Way". 
** And of course, you'll also need to put one or more "Mirrors of the Home-Way" on 
** your map for the heroes to visit. Happy traveling! :-)
