** Updated: November 22, 2006

** Week of Monsters ERM Script Version 1.8 created by Timothy Pulver
** with minor modifications by Anders Jonnson
** and suggestions by Donald X. Vaccarino and the Qurqirish Dragon
** modified by Doom3d (v1.8: map size dependent maximum number of Wondering Monsters.. )
** Requires WoG version 3.58 or later using ERM version 2.70 or later.

** This script replaces the standard "Week of the" results that appear each
** day 1, as well as eliminating the monthly "Month of the" results that
** "double population" and place new monsters on the map. Plague is also
** eliminated.

** Instead, EVERY week except week 1 is a week of a monster. This gives
** all monsters of that type a 33% bonus (rounding down but with a minimum
** bonus of +1) to Attack, Defense, Health, Speed, Damage, and a 50%
** bonus to Growth for the entire week. If the monster type is neutral, rather
** than one that may be recruited from a town, there is no Growth bonus.

** There are also weeks of the various War Machines but these bonuses are
** more limited -- usually to health and defense but sometimes also to
** attack and damage.

** To install this script in a map, simply copy & paste the code into a global
** (timed) event. Copy the entire code, from ZVSE to the end. Make sure
** that you disable ALL colours from receiving the event and/or change
** the event day to something like 600 or later to avoid the ERM script
** popping up as if it were a regular event message. The title of the event
** is unimportant, but I would suggest something like "Week of Monster".
** Have fun and enjoy the Monster Mash! :-)

** Version 1.1 adds a check for the Deity of Fire - if it's present, it will be
** "Week of the Imp" (with +15 Imp *and* +15 Familiar Growth).

** Version 1.2 adds special weeks for resources where mines of that type
** produce double the number (e.g., 2 crystals for Week of the Sparkling
** Crystals, 4 Wood for  Week of the Woodcutter).

** Version 1.3 switches from totally random monster weeks to a monster that
** is present in a hero's army, cycling through all the players in a random
** fixed order. Once per cycle, a completely random monster week will still
** occur, as well as a resource week. This version also adds some wandering
** monsters if it's a monster week or some resource piles if it's a resource
** week. In addition, any Refugee Camps on the map will offer the monster of
** the week unless it's a war machine or resource week in which case it's
** random as normal. Also, week 1 will always be a level 1 monster. The last
** feature this version adds is a reminder of the week's monster and bonuses
** by right-clicking on the End-Turn button.

** Version 1.4 fixes a bug with Imps not growing at all if a Deity of Fire
** is built.

** Version 1.5 is updated to work with new creatures in 3.58. It also reworks
** a function so that it's not recursive and prevents there being more than 48
** Wandering Monsters on a map at any one time due to the slow-downs that
** too many WMs cause.

** Version 1.6 makes the Refugee Camp synchonization a separate option so it
** can be disabled if desired. It also fixes a few related bugs.

** Version 1.7 gives Warlord's Banners to 33% of wandering/stationary monsters.

** Version 1.8  maximum number of Wandering monsters now increased and map size dependent.
** Increased weekly growth.  {map size]/18 per level. Means S 2, M 4, L 6, XL: 8 per level.
** Game level dependent (and random) monster's agression and escape ability.  ->
** MAX number of WMs = ([{map size]/18]^2 :2 +{map size] +8) *{number of map levels}
** So S 12, M 20, L 32, XL: 48 per map level.  Non-standard map sizes are now handled. (18*18..252*252)
** Monster's agression: 2+ R[2* {game level}-4]    So 2-10 at easy,.., 8-10 at expert,
** and 10(never join) at impossible.
** Escape ability: 80% - 20%*{game level}. So 80% at easy, .., 20% at expert, and never escape at impossible.
** 100% -20% *{game level} chance to carry Warlord's Banner. 100% at easy, .. 20% at impossible.
; remarks
*** FU5310 speeded up, using v24= last WM checked in this turn
*** modifications marked with '*Z..**Z'
*** If You modify this script: Please, do not increase MAX number of WMs above 160. (80/map level)
*   Otherwise WoG may stop responding, or You may experience critical slowdowns.
*** Recommended hardwer for WoG, if this option is enabled:
*** PentiumI 233 Mhz MMX, 64MB EDO RAM, S3 Trio64, or better

** Version 1.81 FU5304, and FU5310 were rewritten, now faster execution. Same functionality as above.
*** Remark: TM62-> FU180 loop (among others) ->FU5303(..) -> FU5304(..) ->FU5310(..)
** Version 1.82 FU5310 eliminated, FU5304 even faster. Same functionality. v24-v25 not used.

** v1.83 Check for Diplomacy boost script.
** add a check for script / option 96 (Diplomancy Boost), and set the aggression always to 10 (never join),
** if it is enabled.
