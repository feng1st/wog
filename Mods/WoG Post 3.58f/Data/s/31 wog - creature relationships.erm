** Note: this script requires a WoG version that supports the "e"(floating point) variables.
** If one army contains troops that hate each-other, this script creates a chance that
** each day a fight may break out. The chance is ((14-2D)*M)%, where D is the hero's
** diplomacy skill (0..3), and M is the hero's level of negative morale, plus 1.
** Creatures lost is equal to 10% the HP of the opposing faction in the army, reduced
** by 1% for each level of the hero's luck skill. At least one creature will be lost
** from each faction, unless a faction has less than 14 hit points total.
** version 1.2 additions: new hatreds, affinities- if troops that like each-other are
** in one army, they may improve.
** version 1.3: explicit messages for lost and upgraded troops added.
** version 1.3.1: creature experience accounted for in HE:C commands
