** Mysterious Creature Dwelling 2.1 - by Dieter Averbeck
** Changes Version 2.1 by Thomas Franz (samot)
** This Script gives any visiting Hero once 7 random
** creatures in addition to the heroe's.
** WoGify Name: script15.erm
** Updated: 17.09.2004

** Changes Version 2.0
** 1. Conflux Heroes are added
** 2. New filling system for a better balance. Creature Level
**    depends on var, which counts up every week and decreases
**    after each players visit
** 3. AI gets creatures, too
** 4. Text Changes

** Changes Version 2.1 by Thomas Franz (samot)
** 1. Modified Filling system - didn't depend on week but on hero level
**    in version 2.0 it was possible to enter the MCD with an L1 hero and get L7
**    Creatures, now you will need at least an L18 hero for L7 creatures but you will
**    get (with a little bit luck) three more
** 2. rewritten (shortened and optimized) give function

** Changes Version 2.2 by Thomas Franz (samot)
** 1. The Filling System is based at level or time. You may visit the MCD with your L18
**    hero in week 1 and get L7 or you wait until Week 18 and vistit it with a L1 hero
**    and have the same chances to get L7-Units

** Variables Used: v141-v143, z141-z143, w14
** Flags Used: 140,141
** Functions Used: FU141-FU145, FU148
