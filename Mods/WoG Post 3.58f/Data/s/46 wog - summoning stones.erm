**  Summoning Stones Script Version 1.2 created by Timothy E. Pulver
**  Requires WoG version 3.58 or later using ERM version 2.7 or later. 
**  WoGify Name: script32.erm 
**  Updated: September 12, 2004
 
** This script lets a hero summon creatures from any town the player 
** owns by visiting the Summoning Stones. Each stone ring may be used once 
** per day to summon a single type of creature. Summoned creatures may 
** be purchased from creature dwellings in a town, or may simply be 
** transported if they're already in the town garrison. Town Garrison
** creatures will retain any experience they already have.
 
** When buying new creatures, the total number available must be bought. 
** If you wish to buy fewer, you should recruit them in the town instead 
** and then summon them from the town's garrison. 
 
** If you don't accept the newly summoned creatures into your army they 
** will either fight or run away. If they were previously unbought, you 
** will still have used the gold to pay for them.
