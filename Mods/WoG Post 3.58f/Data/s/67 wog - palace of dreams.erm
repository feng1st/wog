**   Palace of Dreams Version 1.4a created by Timothy E. Pulver 
**   with message box optimization by Tobyn (version 1.4a)
**   Requires WoG version 3.57 or later using ERM version 2.6 or later. 
**   WoGify Name: script11.erm 
**   Updated: June 16, 2004
 
** This script lets any "Big Turreted Palace" on a map function as a casino 
** named "The Palace of Dreams", which is filled with slot machines. The 
** cost to play is 100 gold coins per game. The game simulates slot machines 
** with three wheels that spin around randomly. There are two types of 
** machine to choose from -- On the wheels of one are images of the 
** standard seven Heroes resources (including gold). If all three of the 
** wheels come up the same picture, the player wins resources of that type. 
** The prizes get higher later in the game as a balancing factor. The 
** slot machines in the Palace of Dreams casino can be played as often 
** as the player wishes, or at least until he or she runs out of money... 
 
** The other type of machine is artifacts - randomly chosen. The chances 
** of getting three of the same type from over 100 artifacts is very small 
** so the game is rigged in the player's favour -- he or she can expect 
** to win (on average) about 1 random artifact for every 4,000 gold spent. 
 
** Each time the Palace of Dreams is visited (or revisited), 400 movement 
** points are removed from the hero, however, once playing one type of 
** slot machine or the other, he or she can continue to play until he/she 
** runs out of gold. 
 
** This version of the script also adds AI support -- the AI can visit 
** the casino and gamble a bit (random response to dialogs) but won't 
** often visit because it's not a standard object. In fact, the AI may 
** not visit at ALL unless forced to travel through the entrance square 
** to reach something of value, but the code's in there just in case. 
 
** Version 1.2 also restricts artifacts to those that are enabled. 
** This means that combination artifacts will *not* normally show up, 
** but will show up if the mapmaker has enabled them. Also, relics 
** have a reduced chance of showing up. The new WoG artifacts will 
** show up only if enabled with ERM code. The chance of winning 
** resources has been slightly increased in this version as well, 
** but the amounts have been slightly lowered. 
 
** Version 1.3 adds support for Commander artifacts and fixes a 
** bug that was sometimes causing the game to crash during extended 
** visits to the Palace of Dreams. 

** Version 1.4 makes a minor adjustment to the chance of getting a 
** resource prize (it's slightly less likely but not much change) and
** changes the recursive function call to a non-recursive DO function loop.

** Version 1.4a (Tobyn mod) uses same messagebox where wheel results are
** displayed to ask if player wants to play again.
 
** The "Big Turreted Palace" is a new WoG object that can be found in the 
** WoG Heroes map editor in the Town Objects section. It's the 9th object 
** below the Random Town and immediately below a big purple mushroom. 
** It appears as a large palace with turrets (not to be confused with the other 
** new large palaces, which may or may not have turrets). 
 
** To install this script in a map, simply copy & paste the code into a global 
** (timed) event. Copy the entire code, from ZVSE to the end. Make sure 
** that you disable ALL colours from receiving the event and/or change 
** the event day to something like 500 or later to avoid the ERM script 
** popping up as if it were a regular event message. The title of the event 
** is unimportant, but I would suggest something like "Palace of Dreams". 
** And of course, you'll also need to put one or more "Big Turreted Palaces" 
** on your map for the heroes to visit. Get three and WIN! :-)
