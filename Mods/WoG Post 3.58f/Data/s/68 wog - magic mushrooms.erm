*** Magic Mushrooms  ***
***     By Bruno     ***
***       V1.10g     ***
************************

- AI support 10e
- This version is working well 10.d
- Thanks To Donald for his suggestions and his help

Modified by Thomas Franz (samot):
- freeing usage of w24-27, FU10 and TM10
- replaced FU11 by FU48
- added check, if hero forgot his Magic skill (Market of Time / Advanced Witchhut) to
  prevent, that the hero gets more skills as allowed

When you visit the Mushroom, your hero gains Expert level in
one of the four schools of magic for the rest of the week.
This works even if your hero has all eight skill slots filled.

Usage:
FU48
w20-w23 to track hero visits to mushrooms and previous skill levels (31 = not visited, <4 = previous skill level)
z11-z17 and z159 for hint texts
