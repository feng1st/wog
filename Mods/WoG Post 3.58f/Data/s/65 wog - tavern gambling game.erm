**   Tavern Card Game ERM Script Version 1.2 created by Timothy E. Pulver 
**   Updated: September 18, 2003
 
** This script enhances all standalone Taverns on a map by adding a simple 
** gambling game where heroes can gamble away their hard-won gold. It's 
** purely a game of chance with few real decisions, but you can choose to 
** put down a high or low stake which will determine how much you'll end up 
** winning or losing. For example, if there are 3 other players, the low stake 
** will be 300 gold and the high stake will be 3000. A hero's luck bonus plays 
** a role in the equation too. The higher the luck bonus, the more chance of 
** winning. And if the hero knows the Fortune spell (and has enough spell 
** points left), he or she will be given the opportunity to cast it. The grand 
** prize in this game is a magical pendant in addition to a nice return on your 
** gold. However, if a hero gets TOO lucky or wins too often the other card 
** players may accuse the hero of cheating or the tavern owner may bar him 
** or her from playing for awhile. The tavern also continues to function as 
** usual as a place to recruit new heroes. 
 
** To install this script in a map, simply copy & paste the code into a global 
** (timed) event. Copy the entire code, from ZVSE to the end. Make sure that 
** you disable ALL colours from receiving the event and/or change the event 
** day to 500 or later to avoid the ERM script popping up as if it were a 
** regular event message. 
 
** And of course, you'll also need to put one or more Taverns on your map for 
** the heroes to visit. Happy gambling! :-) 

** Version 1.2 automatically equips any amulets won, using the new HE:A4 command.
